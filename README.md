This repo contains the source code to run an application for analyzing textual data and providing information from the read data (stored as a vector database). It implements RAG-based prompting to achieve better results from LLMs instead of them hallucinating something. This [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoqgmWV1fm8&t=3354s) contains a better explanation of the code. Thanks!
